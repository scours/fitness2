  "abstract": "D-5 Beverage filling: Beverage containers are usually filled at speeds of several tens of thousands of bottles per hour. A bottle filling line, be it for non-returnable or returnable containers, comprises operations from de-stacking, bottle cleaning, filling, closing, labelling, followed by the steps for producing the secondary package and the unit load. From these steps, the most critical step, namely filling, is addressed in this lecture. Dosing of beverages and especially filling of rigid bottles under very low levels of oxygen are focused. Different ways for the subsequent steps of closing and labelling are also shown.",
