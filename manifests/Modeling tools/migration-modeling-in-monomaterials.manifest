  "abstract": "Desorption of substances from materials in direct contact with food (of finite volume $V_F$) is coined migration. This mass transfer is full described in a simple case by the a dimensionless time Fo=D_Pxt/l_p^2 , the packaging-to-food volume ratio L_PF=V_P/V_F and the partition coefficient K_FP=C_P^eq/C_Peq. This lecture will explain why the migration is so different between fatty and aqueous food products, between a rubber and a glassy material, between a small and large migrant...  - level intermediate",
