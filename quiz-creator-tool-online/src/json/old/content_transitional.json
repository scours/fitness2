From these simple considerations, a full monotonic algebra can be derived. As an example: min+min=min, max+max=max.  This lecture presents *physically-inspired* rules to derive similar monotonic scenarios for migration modeling. Two principles i) the mass action law (all transfer are proportional to initial amounts, transferred amounts cannot exceed total migration) and ii) entropy production (maximizing the dispersion of substances with time) are used to build robust scenarios subjected to strong uncertainties on chemical affinities and diffusivities. A methodology for a judicious choice of transport and thermodynamic parameters is exemplified.

Non-food uses are more durable, while the lifespan of plastic packaging usually does not exceed half a year. The fragmentation of uncollected plastics and their reuse as recycled textile fibers is the main source of microplastics and marine litter. The understanding of biodegradation phenomena is essential to appreciate the impact of plastics on the environment, whether they are biodegradable or not.     - Level basic, intermediate",

Today, pollution by plastics, due to mismanagement of the collection system, is one of the most important global issue facing our society.\nThe first part of this unit is devoted to the environmental impact of plastics. Global data on plastics for food packaging are presented as well as the health risk associated with microplastics in soils and oceans.\nThe second part of this unit is dedicated to the recycling of plastics. In this section, the actors in the recycling chain and the regulations related to the recycling process, materials and labels are discussed. Next, the concept of recyclability and the differences in recycling terminology (recyclable, renewable, biodegradable, compostable…) are explained. Finally, the main differences between mechanical and chemical recycling are explained.\n",

Thanks to their versatility and workability, plastics have been used to meet all the needs of human beings, from physiological needs, safety, social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Today, pollution by plastics, due to mismanagement of the collection system, is one of the most important global issue facing our society.\nThe first part of this unit is devoted to the environmental impact of plastics. Global data on plastics for food packaging are presented as well as the health risk associated with microplastics in soils and oceans.\nThe second part of this unit is dedicated to the recycling of plastics. In this section, the actors in the recycling chain and the regulations related to the recycling process, materials and labels are discussed. Next, the concept of recyclability and the differences in recycling terminology (recyclable, renewable, biodegradable, compostable…) are explained.

"abstract":"How to fill small 25 g chip bags at a high rate and with a precise weight without breaking them. This is the challenge of filling packaging with solid food. The weight cannot be exact in relation to the printed value on the package, but it must absolutely be within precise tolerance values by legislation in place (European rules). This lecture presents the principles and their implementation for powdered dry food but also for ready meals that do not flow.    - level intermediate, advanced",
